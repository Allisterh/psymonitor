Description: The *psymonitor* package provides an R implementation of the popular real-time
             monitoring strategy proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new 
             bootstrap procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of heteroskedasticity and
             to effect family-wise size control in recursive testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi,
             forthcoming). This methodology has been shown effective for bubble and crisis detection 
             (PSY, 2015a,b; Phillips and Shi, 2017) and is now widely used by academic researchers,
             central bank economists, and fiscal regulators.
