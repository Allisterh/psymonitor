Description: The *psymonitor* package provides an R
    implementation of the popular real-time monitoring strategy proposed
    by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new bootstrap
    procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of
    heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise size control in recursive
    testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming). This methodology
    has been shown effective for bubble and crisis detection (PSY,
    2015a,b; Phillips and Shi, 2017) and is now widely used by academic
    researchers, central bank economists, and fiscal regulators.
