Description: Apply the popular real-time monitoring strategy
    proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new
    bootstrap procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of
    heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise size control in recursive
    testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming).
