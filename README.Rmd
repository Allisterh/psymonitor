The *psymonitor* package provides an R implementation of the popular real-time monitoring strategy proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new bootstrap procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise size control in recursive testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming). This methodology has been shown effective for bubble and crisis detection (PSY, 2015a,b; Phillips and Shi, 2017) and is now widely used by academic researchers, central bank economists, and fiscal regulators.

## Installation

You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/psymonitor/)

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itamarcaspi/psymonitor")
```

## Example

For the illustration purposes we will use data on the credit risk in the European sovereign sector, that is proxied by an index constructed as a GDP weighted 10-year government bond yield of the GIIPS (Spain, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Portugal) countries, and comes with the 'psymonitor' package.

Letâ€™s walk through some basics. First load packages and get some data.

```{r data, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(psymonitor)

data(spread)
head(spread)
```

Next, estimate the psy test statistic using PSY() and its corresponding bootstrap-based critical values using wmboot().

```{r test, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
y        <- spread$value
obs      <- length(y)
swindow0 <- floor(obs * (0.01 + 1.8 / sqrt(obs)))
Tb       <- 24 + swindow0 - 1
dim      <- obs - swindow0 + 1

bsadf          <- PSY(y)
quantilesBsadf <- wmboot(y, Tb = Tb, nboot = 99, nCores = 2) #Note that the number of cores is arbitrarily set to 2.

```

Next, identify crisis periods, defined as periods where the test statistic is above its corresponding critical value, using the locate() function.

```{r dateStamp, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
monitorDates <- spread$date[swindow0:obs]
quantile95   <- quantilesBsadf %*% matrix(1, nrow = 1, ncol = dim)
ind95        <- (bsadf > t(quantile95[2, ])) * 1
periods      <- locate(ind95, monitorDates)
```

Finally, print a table that holds the identified crisis periods with the help of the disp() function.

```{r printResults, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
crisisDates <- disp(periods, obs)
print(crisisDates)
```
